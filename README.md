- 👋 Hi, I’m @physicscitizen
- 👀 I’m interested in multi-Higgs Particle Physics and solid state particle detectors
- 🌱 I’m currently learning not as much as the Neural Nets do.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting out of doing more bureaucracy
- 📫 How to reach me - If you know me you can easily find me because I'm a particle physicist.
